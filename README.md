# bogdanzogovic — personal project README 8/30/2025
## At-a-glance

- Repository: `bogdanzogovic` (owner: `vanta9001`)
- Git branch: `main`
- Primary entry: `index.html`

## Quick stats

These numbers were collected from the workspace at the time this README was updated.

- Total files: 1168
- Code files (js/ts/py/rb/go): 2
- Files in `assets/`: 57
- Image files in `assets/`: 49

> If you want fresh numbers, run a quick filesystem count from the repo root.

Note: the `photos/` directory contains many high-resolution images and makes the repo large — consider pruning, moving heavy originals to external storage, or keeping only web-optimized derivatives in the repository.

## What this project contains (short)

- Static site: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
- Static assets under `assets/` (fonts, images, CSS fragments)
- Deployment config: `vercel.json`
- License: `LICENSE.md`

## How I usually open / test this locally

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a simple HTTP server).

If you want a quick local server (from repo root):

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser.

## Notes / reminders (personal)

- This is primarily a static portfolio page. Small and intentionally simple.
- Consider adding a tiny test or CI if you start adding logic.
- Keep third-party assets minimal and prefer web-optimized images.

## Next steps I might do later

1. Add a short CHANGELOG or use GitHub releases for visible history.
2. Add a tiny script to regenerate these stats automatically (optional).
3. Add unit tests if JS logic grows.

## Requirements coverage

- Create a README: Done
- Include project stats: Done (file counts, asset counts, branch)
- Keep it personal/concise: Done

If you want any specific meta added (last-deployed SHA, CI badge, or a shorter/longer personal blurb), tell me what to include and I will update this file.
